 * invert parity for each "on" bit. What could be simpler?
 * Sadly, it doesn't work and I don't know why.
 * Leaving it for the next programmer to work it out...""

/* Function: parityB
 * -----------------
 * Simon says: "My second attempt, changed up my loop to shift
 * value down each iteration and test bit at position of least
 * significance. When I xor parity against lsb, this inverts
 * parity if lsb is 'on', no change if lsb 'off'. Perfect,
 * just what I wanted. I tested this code and it works great."
 *
 * You say: but did you test on negative inputs? I don't think so...
