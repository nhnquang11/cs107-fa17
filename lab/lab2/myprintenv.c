/* Function: main
 * --------------
 * Ordinarily main() has just two arguments (argc/argv); this alternate
 * prototype includes an optional third argument which is an array of
 * environment variables (like argc/argv, the values passed to this third
 * arg are set automatically by the operating system when the program is 
 * launched). Programs can use either form for main. The 2-argument 
 * version is more common, but this program will use the main with
 * 3rd argument to get access to the environment variables.
 * (In fact, many programmers don't even know about this optional 3rd
 * argument, so now you're already elite! :-) )
 *
 * Each array entry in this third argument is a string (pointer char*), 
 * where the string pointed to is of the form "NAME=value", for different
 * environment variable NAMEs and configuration values. The array's last 
 * entry is a NULL pointer, which acts as a sentinel to identify the
 * end of the array (which is why we can get away with not including an 
 * accompanying array size argument, as we would normally do when passing 
 * arrays in C).
